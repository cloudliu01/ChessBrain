# ChessBrain Constitution

<!-- High-level guiding principles only; no specs, requirements, or implementation details -->

## Core Principles

### I. Demonstrability and Practicality

ChessBrain exists to **be seen, used, and understood**. Every feature should deliver an experience that is intuitive, responsive, and interpretable — something that users can interact with and learn from directly.

### II. Testability as Foundation

Everything must be **verifiable**. Core logic must be testable in isolation; behavior must be reproducible; failures must be diagnosable and traceable.
If it can’t be tested, it’s not considered done.

### III. Simplicity Over Complexity

Solve problems with the simplest viable design. Each module has a single responsibility and clear boundaries. Avoid speculative complexity — clarity and maintainability always outweigh premature optimization.

### IV. Modularity and Replaceability

Front-end, back-end, database, training, and inference layers must be decoupled and communicate via clear contracts. Any layer can evolve independently without breaking the others.
**Intelligence emerges from composition, not entanglement.**

### V. Engineering Consistency

A single, coherent set of conventions governs naming, structure, and interfaces across all layers. Anyone should be able to navigate the codebase and understand where things belong without prior context.

### VI. Mainstream and Reliable Foundations

Favor proven frameworks, architectures, and standards. Respect community best practices. Never reinvent wheels unless you can prove necessity, long-term maintainability, and measurable benefit.

### VII. Deployability as a Core Value

Design from day one for deployment.
Environment setup must be **describable**, configurations **injectable**, dependencies **resolvable**, and upgrades **reversible**.
Deployment must be repeatable, auditable, and rollback-safe.

### VIII. Observability and Explainability

Every key operation — data flow, model behavior, and service interaction — must be observable. Metrics, logs, and traces form a closed feedback loop.
All major model decisions should be explainable and visualizable.

### IX. Responsible Data and Model Boundaries

Data must be lawful, minimal, and bounded in retention. Training and inference should be reproducible and traceable.
Always make the distinction between **facts** and **estimates** explicit to avoid misleading outcomes.

### X. Cross-Platform Portability and Performance

Training and inference must run reliably on both **macOS** and **NVIDIA-based systems**, with predictable performance and identical correctness. Optimize without sacrificing determinism or clarity.

## Engineering and Platform Constraints

* **Testing Priority:** Unit, contract, and end-to-end tests must cover all critical paths. Any public interface change must explicitly state whether it is backward-compatible or requires migration.
* **Structure and Layers:** Organize by abstraction level — Interface → Domain → Infrastructure. Visualization, service, data, and learning modules should be self-contained and communicate only through defined APIs.
* **Configuration and Secrets:** Externalize configuration; use environment-driven settings; never embed secrets in code or database. Local and production deployments differ only by configuration.
* **Deployment Model:** Support both local demo and cloud/server deployments from the same build artifacts.
* **State Management:** Version control all data and model artifacts. Support rollback for critical assets. Prefer immutable releases.
* **Compatibility:** Design for gradual evolution. Breaking changes must come with evaluation, notice, and a migration path.
* **Front/Back Contract:** Maintain stable APIs; errors must be classifiable, diagnosable, and recoverable. Design for resilience to partial failure and network instability.

## Development Culture

* **Clarity Before Code:** Document *why* something exists, *when* to use it, *when not to*, and *how to validate it* — before writing the first line.
* **Review as Education:** Code reviews focus on alignment with this constitution — reducing complexity, improving testability and observability, and preventing unnecessary innovation.
* **Incremental Progress:** Build small, test small, deploy small. Each iteration should deliver measurable, verifiable improvement.
* **Evidence-Based Decisions:** Let experiments and metrics guide changes, not opinions or hierarchy. Results must be reproducible and attributable.
* **User at the Table:** User experience and demonstration quality are first-class citizens. Explainability and visualization are not “nice-to-haves” — they are functional requirements.

## Governance

This Constitution overrides personal preferences, coding trends, or transient optimizations.
Any deviation requires justification, risk assessment, and a rollback plan.
Amendments must document motivation, scope, and transition strategy.

The ultimate test for every decision:
**Does it make ChessBrain more testable, more deployable, more explainable, and more demonstrable?**
